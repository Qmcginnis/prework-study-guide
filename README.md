# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description
This project is the Prework Study Guide that was built in order to incorperate new learning ideals and a developer mindset into the work we will be putting out. The motivation behind this project was to better understand what goes into coding and the mindset needed to be successful while coding. This project was built to learn the basics and incorperate new knowledge into a succint easy to access package. This solves the issue of not knowing where the program is headed and giving us tools to help us develop successfully. Over the course of building thus Prework Study Guide I have learned the basics on git, css, js, and html and further learned how to implement all of those into a stable program with depth and ease of interfacing.
